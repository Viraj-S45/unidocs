# Hardware Requirements for a Home Lab Server

Setting up a home lab server starts with choosing the right hardware. In this guide, we’ll outline the **minimum and recommended hardware specifications**, important considerations for power and cooling, and tips on repurposing old hardware like I did in [My Home Lab Setup](#my-home-lab-server-setup).

## Minimum and Recommended Hardware Specifications

When selecting hardware for your home lab, consider the type of workloads you plan to run. Here’s a quick reference:

### **Minimum Requirements**  
For lightweight workloads like running a few Docker containers or small personal projects:
- **CPU:** Dual-core processor (e.g., Intel i3-3220 or AMD Athlon)  
- **RAM:** 4GB  
- **Storage:** 250GB HDD or SSD  
- **Network:** Ethernet with stable internet access (minimum 10 Mbps)  

### **Recommended Requirements**  
For more demanding workloads, multiple services, or virtualization:
- **CPU:** Quad-core processor or higher (e.g., Intel i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600G)  
- **RAM:** 8GB to 16GB (expandable)  
- **Storage:**  
  - 500GB SSD for fast access to OS and critical services  
  - 1TB HDD for data storage  
- **Network:** Ethernet with 24x7 uptime and internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher  

> *If you're planning to run resource-heavy services like media servers (e.g., Jellyfin or Plex), aim for a CPU with hardware transcoding capabilities.*

## CPU, RAM, and Storage Considerations

### **CPU**  
- Focus on multi-core processors to handle multiple services efficiently.  
- Opt for processors with **low power consumption** (e.g., Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen series).  

### **RAM**  
- 4GB is the bare minimum for basic tasks, but for running Docker containers or virtualization, **8GB or more** is strongly recommended.  
- Check if your motherboard supports RAM upgrades for future scalability.  

### **Storage**  
- SSDs provide better performance for OS and applications compared to HDDs.  
- Consider having **separate drives** for system files and data storage to improve reliability.

## Power and Cooling Requirements

### **Power**
- Ensure your power supply has sufficient wattage for your components. For older hardware, a **300W PSU** is often sufficient.  
- Use a **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** to protect your server from sudden power outages.  

### **Cooling**
- Proper cooling is critical to ensure system stability and longevity.  
- Clean out dust regularly and ensure good airflow by organizing cables.  
- If your server is running 24x7, consider using **low-noise case fans** or upgrading to a larger, quieter CPU cooler.

## Repurposing Old Hardware

A great way to get started with a home lab server is by **repurposing old hardware**. Here's how I did it in [My Home Lab Setup](#my-home-lab-server-setup):

- **CPU:** Intel i3-3220 (4 cores) @ 3.3GHz  
- **RAM:** 6GB  
- **Storage:** A mix of 1TB HDD and 500GB SSD for performance and capacity.  
- **Network:** Ethernet with 40 Mbps speed for reliable connectivity.  

This setup, while modest, allows me to run **17 Docker containers** efficiently, including tools like Nextcloud, Jellyfin, and Portainer.

> **Tip:** If you’re upgrading your old PC, prioritize adding more RAM and replacing the HDD with an SSD. These upgrades can dramatically improve performance.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Test Your Hardware**  
  Before deploying your server, run stress tests to ensure stability. Tools like `memtest86` and CPU benchmarking software can help identify potential bottlenecks.  

- **Future-Proofing**  
  If budget permits, invest in hardware that allows for **easy upgrades**, such as motherboards with extra RAM slots or support for additional drives.
